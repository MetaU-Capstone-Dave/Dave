# SkillSwap

## Overview

SkillSwap is a community-driven platform designed to connect people who want to share or learn skills through informal sessions. The app facilitates skill exchange by enabling users to post skill offers or requests, search for relevant opportunities by category or location, and connect with others interested in peer-to-peer learning. This platform empowers users to grow their abilities and build local or online communities based on shared knowledge. SkillSwap is scalable, easy to use, and fosters continuous learning and collaboration especially at the workplace.
