# Dave

## Overview

Dave is a custom solution designed to address the college counseling struggles faced by African students. In a region where access to college counseling services is often limited, Dave offers an easy-to-use, scalable, and entirely free platform. It empowers low-income students to access counseling and prepare effectively for college applications. At its core, Dave is a system crafted to guide students, regardless of their starting point, from novices in college research to experts in networking, essay writing, personal branding, and other skills essential for the college application journey. With Dave, students can receive world-class mentorship and connect with fellow African students who are either already enrolled at prestigious institutions or in the process of applying to colleges.
